if you want hack on this project there are many places to start. You can add languages by adding grammars and lexers for examples. To add a different display method from dot files, you can write a new tree generator from the CKYChart class provided by cyk.py. The dot file generation is in viz.py and is essentially a Bredth first search on the graph/table. CYKChart is a table and remember that graphs and tables are mathmaically the same thing. Look at genTree in viz.py, it generates a tree from the graph, you can generate a different tree in say, xml to create an SVG or a JASON object to pass it to javascript to make a more interactive graph. Remember that you are not limited to LL or LR grammars. You can do any Context Free Grammar.
